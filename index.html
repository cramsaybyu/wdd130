        <p>Hello! My name is Carlette Ramsay. I am currently a student at BYU-Idaho studying Web Design and Development.
            I have a passion for learning new things and creating beautiful designs. In my free time, I enjoy hiking,
            reading, and spending time with my family.</p>
        <p>I am excited to be a part of this course and look forward to learning more about web design and development.
            I hope to create a portfolio of work that showcases my skills and creativity.</p>
